        <h2>ASSIGNMENT 1 – <span>CREATION</span></h2>
        
        <h3>What is your concrete topic?</h3>
        <p>Digital gardens – The design of current social media promotes the shallow, mindless consumption of content. We jump from topic to topic, numbing ourselves to what we're seeing instead of developing any depth to what we're absorbing. Not only that, but our platforms are also designed in a way that helps us cater the perfect image towards others.</p>
        <p>When was the last time we created something that was purely for ourselves? We have platforms that have given us a voice to connect with others but it's about catering a specific image of who we are.</p>
        <p>Almost as a rejection of these social media types, there is a movement of spaces that reject the patterns social media has defined as the normal. These are called digital gardens. They are often websites by developers or code-hobbyists to log literally anything in their life. It ranges from catalogs of books they recommend, to life hacks, to simply a journal of their thoughts.</p> 
        <p>These are extremely personal projects–called digital gardens because it's a space that's just for you, not for anyone else. A space for exploration, creativity, knowledge, and mostly depth. It's not based on an algorithm that will cater the content for you, but instead purely a chance for discovery and connection.</p>
        
        <h3>What is the goal of the project?</h3>
        <p>The goal of the project is to create a low-barrier-to-entry tool in which users can create their own "digital gardens", similar to a personal wiki. It will assist users explore depth of topics, establish connections in between, and have the option to easily share these findings with others. This tool will aim to be highly customizable to accommodate multitude of content types, but simultaneously consistent for a familiar user experience across different users' gardens.</p>

        <h3>What do you like about this idea?</h3>
        <p>What I enjoy about this idea is that it's a tool designed to facilitate growth, deeper thinking, and as a result, self-reflection. I like to think of it as a space where you can forget about how what you have to say or show is going to be perceived by others. It's a canvas that's open enough to fill it in whatever way you want, but organized enough to give you structure and the means to build connections between your thoughts. A space like this should be easily available to anyone who pursues it, rather than being exclusive to those who have the coding knowledge to build it themselves.</p>

        <h3>What elements or factors could risk the achievement of your project?</h3>
        <p>To test how visual design of information architecture can promote depth of exploration, a tree analogy is used to encourage the user to "grow" their garden. It's an experimental approach and sounds good on paper, but it could be risky as it may be too different from what a user is typically used to. The unconventional design of the inverted web of branches may be more difficult to understand or organize.</p>
        <p>Research has also suggested that users may want to make their digital gardens to their own personal taste. While a canvas-style approach was used for the tool to accommodate customizability, the user interface elements have remained simple and consistent to maintain consistent user experience through all users' gardens. This may deter those who want to be very specific in the look of their digital space.</p>

        <h3>What's your inspiration for your project?</h3>
        <p><a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a>–a flexible collaborative workspace that allows for anything ranging from work documents, charts, boards, to personal journals, budgets, and more. Sylva is heavily influenced by Notion's high customizable elements yet consistent user interface components to maintain a simple user experience.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.are.na/">Are.na</a>–a social platform used to connect ideas and build knowledge, claimed to be built as a rejection of current social media norms. Are.na is primarily used as a mood board-esque tool to collect inspiration from a variety of sources. Without using advertising as other social media platforms do, it supposedly promotes conscious usage exploration of the Internet.</p>
